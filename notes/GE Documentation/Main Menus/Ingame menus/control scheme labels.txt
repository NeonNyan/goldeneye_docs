  Here's something neat.  It's the labels that appear on the control scheme menu in the single-player watch.  First, there's the control type itself, then the text for each button.  If somebody hacks the control type list (wherever that is) this is how they'd change the labels.

1FC48	number of control schemes in following list
1FC4C-1FCEC	solo control types and labels for each control	0x14 each
	0x0	2	control type
	0x2	2	A button label
	0x4	2	B button label
	0x6	2	Z button label
	0x8	2	L button label
	0xA	2	R button label
	0xC	2	C button label
	0xE	2	Dpad button label
	0x10	2	Start button label
	0x12	2	Control Stick label


  This is followed by the solo settings in the watch menu.  The address in the original 21990 doc is wrong.  Here's the good one!
1FCEC-1FD4C	solo watch setting labels
	0x0	2	name of setting
	0x2	2	option 1
	0x4	2	option 2
	0x6	2	option 3 (usually blank)
	0x8	4	setting default value
  The default values are sort of nice.  It might help emu users save time setting their favorite settings right when they start the game the first time.  The settings themselves have been released many times before, but if you don't have them I've got them written down.

  You can also set the default data that appears in your eeprom file.  That's at:
B790-BB70	reset for eeprom
  It won't be saved until you finish a stage or something, but you could probably activate all cheats, stages, etc right from the beginning.  I have yet to try copying an eeprom directly into it.

  Still running through the 21990.  An amazing amount of it is dedicated to various debug routines.  Also, some of it includes the Mp watch menu displays, etc.  Accidentally deleted the menu at one point.  Rather funny, actually.
