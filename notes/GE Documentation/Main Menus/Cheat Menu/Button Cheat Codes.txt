A really fun 21990 feature, originally hacked by Krijy.  This table sets up the button codes used to access cheats in-game, the text displayed for the cheats in the cheat menu, and whether text is displayed when a button code is entered.  They correspond to the selectable cheat list generated at 80069650, the cheats selected list at 800696A0, and the data following that address are used for constructing the screen displayed.  

For a quick summary of how this works, each entry in the table corresponds to an available cheat.  Although you can change the order of each cheat, and doing so changes the cheat activated when the button code is used, it will NOT affect the cheat activated through the cheat menu.  So, in other words, there isn't much reason to shuffle the cheat numbers around.

What the table will let you do is assign a button code to a cheat, fiddle with the button code needed to activate the cheat, when each cheat can be triggered, and change any text displayed in the Cheat folder.

JAP	0x1EA6C
USA	0x1EA7C
PAL	0x1A80C

Format:
0x0	1	cheat to activate with code (don't change these)
0x1	1	# keypresses in button input.  00 designates it can not be activated with a button code.
0x2	2	filler
0x4	4	literal Ram pointer to button string (see below for conversion)
0x8	2	text digits - displayed in Cheat folder
0xA	5	filler
0xF	1	bitflags for usage (input times and how often applied)
	x1xx xxxx	constant: multi
	xx1x xxxx	constant: solo			un/set for all players
	xxx1 xxxx	exclusively acts on player 1?	do not un/set activation flag when toggled in play
	xxxx x1xx	at start: multi
	xxxx xx1x	at start: solo
	xxxx xxx1	usable on folder screens

  By default, cheats are deactivated on a per-player basis.

Each button code is 0x14 in size.  Each button input is 2 bytes long and coresponds to the button input from the controller.  That makes 10 input slots per code.  Each uses a literal Ram pointer to target the string of buttons, but they can be anywhere in the file if need be.  Not all are assigned to usable cheats anyway, and some aren't assigned to anything at all!  Otherwise, it wouldn't be hard to limit the number.

conversions for pointer
JAP	-80020DD0
USA	-80020D90
PAL	-8001EC50
that will return an offset within the 21990 file.

The list of button input codes spans from:
JAP	0x1E690	0x1EA6C
USA	0x1E6A0	0x1EA7C
PAL	0x1A430	0x1A80C

The 2 byte button code masks are the same as usual:
1xxx xxxx xxxx xxxx	A button
x1xx xxxx xxxx xxxx	B button
xx1x xxxx xxxx xxxx	Z button
xxx1 xxxx xxxx xxxx	Start
xxxx 1xxx xxxx xxxx	D-up
xxxx x1xx xxxx xxxx	D-down
