  Proposed alteration to Briefing files:  Objective entries will allow being toggled per-difficulty.  Also, allow flags to act as locks to untoggle objectives mid-stage.  Eventually will need to remove the 10 objective limit, though anything over 10 is ignored in original game...  Calculated limit is 20 without diminishing lock byte to nibble.  Format of briefing files:	0x30 large0x0	2	"Background" page text ID0x2	2	"M Briefing" page text ID0x4	2	"Q Branch" page text ID0x6	2	"Moneypenny" page text ID0x8	objective entries	max of 10 (0xA)	0x0	2	text ID	0x1	1	lock flags	0x2	1	flags		03	minimum difficulty available on		04	do not allow on agent		08	do not allow on secret agent		10	do not allow on 00 agent		20	do not allow on 007		C0	RESERVED  By retaining the 0x3 mask, should remain backward-compatible.  Under new rules, should then be able to use the flags to omit certain difficulty settings on hacked ROMs.  If any flags in the lock value are set, will disallow until matching flags are set in the upper byte of the objective register.  All flags set here must match.  In other words, AND then XOR, fail on inequality.  Objective flags present at 80030978 will not be used.  Unlock will occur using saved objective status values at 80075D58.  This should be set after stage end yet zeroed on stage selection.    Action F1 will need looking at (7F039F38), since it returns TRUE if objectives complete.  +_+  80075D58 table format is converted from words to halfwords.  Upper byte is current lock, lower byte traditional return value.    p->briefing data at 80075D84
