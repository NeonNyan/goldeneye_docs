Dimensions - only 27 type (door) presets!
These are broken up in the format
X min, X max
Y min, Ymax
Z min, Z max
Functionally though it's more complex than that.  Because doors use a different rotation 
than everything else, the actual dimensions you change are more on the line of:
Doors
minimum thickness        maximum thickness
minimum width              maximum width
minimum height             maximum height
Glass, boxes, crates, etc
minimum width              maximum width
minimum thickness        maximum thickness
minimum height             maximum height

Not only that, but this relates to the space the object fills, not the size of the actual 
object.  If you change the scale of the object, for example, the door will look smaller, but 
the space the door moves in will be the same size.  

So, how you read these is kinda weird.  It's all based off an invisible center point - the 
preset location - and these values are added and subtracted from the xyz values!  That's 
why if almost every single one has a positive and identical negative value, though they don't 
really *have* to be...

Also, because this is added to the preset value, you can have an object *hover* in midair or 
seem as thin as a plate!  What you can do is resize a bookshelf so instead of being 
crate-sized it stretches wide and tall.  Tables, bookshelves, alarms, and even the 
Moonraker shuttle all use these for distorts.  

What you can't do is twist an object or bend angles in it.  These are very simple xyz 
additions, nothing more.
