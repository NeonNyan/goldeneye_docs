  There are 42 frames in the bleeding animation, each an intensity-only 80x96 (50x60) image.
  Effectively, these are 1-bit images, indicating red or clear.  This is feathered at least 5 pixels at runtime to give a smoother appearance.

Encrypted Format:

First byte is saved.  Acts as an offset value, indicating how many columns on the left are always filled with FFs when using multirow commands.

There are two commands possible:
command 1: write x duplicate rows of base+y FF's.  Fill rest with zeroes.
value:	3:5	3bits high, 5 bits low
	copy base+value:5 FFs
	fill rest of row with 00s
	loop above two operations value:3 times

command 2: alternate FF/00 writes
value:	FF	alternate FF/00 writes in row.  Starts by writing FFs, then 00s, then FFs, etc.
	next:	!FF	write x bytes
		invert write value from FF<->00
		loop until an FF value is reached
	fill remaining seg.size with current write value

Example 1:
Assume width is 10, for convenience in these examples only
4B.25.FF0104FF
	00	base value.  no offset
	25	Multirow:	1:5 - create two rows (1), each with base + 5 FFs
	FF	Alternate:	start setting FFs
		01	write 1 FF.	Invert write value to 00
		04	write 4 00s.	Invert write value to FF
		FF	fill remaining with FF
	
Result 1:
FF FF FF FF FF 00 00 00 00 00	;multirow command (25)
FF FF FF FF FF 00 00 00 00 00	;multirow command (25)
FF 00 00 00 00 FF FF FF FF FF	;Alternate command (FF0104FF)


Example 2:
Commonly, alternate commands will use 0 to fill left with zeroes before drawing red.
Note, only multirow command use the base value.  This is ignored by alternate commands.
08.FF000304FF.FF000206FF.FF0001030203FF.FF0001030203FF.FF000206FF.FF000304FF
	08	base value.  first 8 blocks are set as FF in multirow command only.
	FF	Alternate:	start setting FFs
		00	write 0 FFs.	Invert write value to 00
		03	write 3 00s.	Invert write value to FF
		04	write 4 FFs.	Invert write value to 00
		FF	fill remaining with 00
	FF	Alternate:	start setting FFs
		00	write 0 FFs.	Invert write value to 00
		02	write 2 00s.	Invert write value to FF
		06	write 6 FFs.	Invert write value to 00
		FF	fill remaining with 00
	FF	Alternate:	start setting FFs
		00	write 0 FFs.	Invert write value to 00
		01	write 1 00s.	Invert write value to FF
		03	write 3 FFs.	Invert write value to 00
		02	write 2 00s.	Invert write value to FF
		03	write 3 FFs.	Invert write value to 00
		FF	fill remaining with 00
	FF	Alternate:	start setting FFs

		01	write 1 00s.	Invert write value to FF
		03	write 3 FFs.	Invert write value to 00
		02	write 2 00s.	Invert write value to FF
		03	write 3 FFs.	Invert write value to 00
		FF	fill remaining with 00
	FF	Alternate:	start setting FFs
		00	write 0 FFs.	Invert write value to 00
		02	write 2 00s.	Invert write value to FF
		06	write 6 FFs.	Invert write value to 00
		FF	fill remaining with 00
	FF	Alternate:	start setting FFs
		00	write 0 FFs.	Invert write value to 00
		03	write 3 00s.	Invert write value to FF
		04	write 4 FFs.	Invert write value to 00
		FF	fill remaining with 00
	
Result 2:
00 00 00 FF FF FF FF 00 00 00
00 00 FF FF FF FF FF FF 00 00
00 FF FF FF 00 00 FF FF FF 00

Example 3:
  Multirow writes are highly efficient.  By setting the base value you can fill most of the image with black and only edit the leading edge.
07.00.01.22.63
	07	base value.	First seven blocks are set FF in multirow commands.
	00	Multirow:	0:0 - create one row (0), each with base + 0 FFs (7)
	01	Multirow:	0:1 - create one row (0), each with base + 1 FFs (8)
	22	Multirow:	1:2 - create two rows (1), each with base + 2 FFs (9)
	63	Multirow:	3:3 - create four rows (3), each with base + 3 FFs (10)
  
Result 3:
FF FF FF FF FF FF FF 00 00 00
