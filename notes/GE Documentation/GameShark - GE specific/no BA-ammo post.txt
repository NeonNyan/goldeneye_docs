They've been tested now and do work on their respective regions.  Let me explain how these work though.
First, this adds a cheat into the in-game "Cheat" menu called "Dr. No".  When on, body armor/armour will not appear in either solo or multiplayer stages.  When off, they still appear normally.

Also, this is an ASM (assembly) hack.  What that means is that emulators don't like them.  Most emulators won't allow the thing to work unless you either reset after activating the codes or activate the code before turning on the game.  Why?  Most emulators cache opcodes to increase performance, but that also means you can't edit or add in a few of your own.  If you've ever had problems getting this or the new scenarios to work, that's probably why.
