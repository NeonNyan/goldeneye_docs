Wow, I really screwed this up badly...
Will go back through docs to correct this...

C0 commands
upper command
00C00000	S mirror(2), clamp(1)
00300000	T mirror(2), clamp(1)
000C0000	ST settilesize offset, which may only be 2 or 0.  Avoids pixelization on edges.
0003C000	S shift
00003C00	T shift
000003F0	RESERVED
00000007	type 0-4

lower command
FF000000	Primcolor diffuse level, used to determine visible distance of overlay images (LOD effect)
00FFF000	Overlay image ID.  Appears when close to the object.
00000FFF	Base image ID.  When overlay present, used at a distance and replaced at close range.

  When special LOD image swapping used, the level byte indicates at what distance from the camera the swap will occur.  It is easier to think of the value as negative: how distant from the camera the swap will occur.

type 0	C0.FFFF.00 LL.000.iii
	Loads image [i] using LOD level [L].  All flags are acceptable.
	Functionally similiar to type 2, except it always sets the LOD.
	In addition, if "joy2 detail edit" is activated, the first instance of an image [i] sets the LOD and shift for all subsequent instances.  See below for more details.

type 1	C0.FFFF.01 LL.ooo.iii
	Level of detail image shifting.  Replaces base image [i] with overlay image [o] when within LOD range.  All flags apply.
	Command requires two image IDs to function or is otherwise ignored.
	Note: technically the "base" and "overlay" are actually the other way around, but this describes the actual behaviour.
	
type 2	C0.FC00.02 00000.iii
	Loads image [i].  Only mirror, clamp, and offset flags are read.
	Most common image loading type.  Sets up to 7 tiles of diminishing size depending on proportions.
	Additionally, if "joy2 detail edit" is activated and LOD data has been saved for this image, the image will be applied at the specified level similiar to a type 0 command.  See below for more details.

type 3	C0.FC00.03 00000.iii
	Loads image [i].  Only mirror, clamp, and offset flags are read.
	Used predominantly for 32x32 indexed images within objects.  Sets the tile twice.

type 4	C0.FC00.04 00000.iii
	Loads image [i].  Only mirror, clamp, and offset flags are read.
	Used especially for large greyscale images within objects.  Only sets the tile once in memory.
