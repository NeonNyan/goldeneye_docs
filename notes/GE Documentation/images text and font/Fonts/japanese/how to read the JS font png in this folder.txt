  In this folder is a file called "JS font.png".  It was output in a very particular way to aid in matching kanji to their binary values.

  First, the binary format uses two bytes, like this:
809F
  The first value (80) is the group code.  There are eight groups total with 0x80 entries each:
80xx
81xx
82xx
83xx
84xx
85xx
86xx
87xx
  The second byte (9F) is the entry number.  These range from 80-FF.

In the image:
  Blue lines denote group codes.  There are eight columns with 80xx starting on the left.
  In each group there are two columns of characters.  This has to do with the way the characters are stored.  They should be counted left to right, down the page like so:
0 1
2 3
4 5
6 7
8 9
A B
C D
E F
  Red horizontal lines break up each clump of 0x10 entries.  The top row is 80, the next 90, and so forth.

+_+

Example:
  Lets find the binary code for "@".  In the image, it appears in the first column and fifth row.  The first column is 80xx, and the fifth row is xxC0.  Starting from the upper left corner of the clump, count left to right starting at 0.  @ is 1.
  Combined altogether, you get 80xx + xxC0 + xxx1, or 80C1.

  Please note that this picture does not include the large-sized font images.
