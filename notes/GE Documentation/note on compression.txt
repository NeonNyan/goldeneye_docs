  Rare used gzip/z compression in all their N64 titles.  There are various header formats used across their games.  GE is the simplest of these, containing nothing but the compressed data.  1172 is used as an indicator for this type.  The decompression algorithm is found at 0x33590 in ROM, set to virtual address 70200000 at runtime.

  GE also uses a huffman compression scheme specificly for certain image types.  Each image is processed as it is decompressed.  More information on this can be found in the "images text and font\Huffman" folder.

Banjo Kazooie
	1172.ssssssss
	[s]	4-byte compressed filesize

	[s]	3-byte compressed filesize

Donkey Kong 64
	1F8B.080000000000.02.03
	This would be a "blank" gzip header, as output by the --no-name flag or compress2 for instance.

Donkey Kong 64 Kiosk

	This gzip header corresponds to a output file "tmp.bin".

Conker's Bad Fur Day
	ssssssss
	[s]	4-byte compressed filesize

  All Rarezip compression types can be decompressed easily by feeding the compressed binary into zlib's decompress() function.
