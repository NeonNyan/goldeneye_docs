  Object headers in Goldeneye are seperate from the object files themselves as in Perfect Dark.  This consists of 0x20 of data, as opposed to 0x1C in Perfect Dark.  GE uses the final field to indicate if the object has been loaded.

  When an object is editted this data must be set!  It indicates how many offsets, images, and whatnot are in the model, as well as the archetype.

0x0	4	RESERVED for runtime: offset to object table
0x4	4	GE - pointer to archetype; PD - archetype number
0x8	4	RESERVED for runtime: offset to object offset block
0xC	2	number of offset entries
0xE	2	number of object groups
0x10	4	[float] UNKNOWN floating point value
0x14	2	RESERVED for runtime: number of entries in table
0x16	2	number of image entries
0x18	4	RESERVED for runtime: offset to image declarations
0x1C	4	GE only - RESERVED for runtime: nonzero indicates model is loaded in memory
