PAL uses a reduced fog/sky/water block format.
NOT ACCURATE except for size.  Did this quickly just to start a document on the subject.
Trust nothing you see


entries 0x24 in size
0x0	2	stage ID number (or multiple thereof)
0x2	2	near pervasiveness of fog on rendered surfaces
0x4	2	far fog value; beyond this is complete obscurity
0x6	2	near fog value; distance from player to start of fog gradient
0x8	2	max obj vis. range; furthest dist standard (non-door) obj and actors are visible at
0xA	2	obj obfuscation range; objs start to 'fade' at this distance
0xC	2	default 996	BG: dif. in light.  smaller # = foggier near player
0xE	2	default 1000	far ambient light value value.  used with above two values
			I think this is when fog occurs, and above two are subtracted to create the near fog boundry.
			permillage.  light/ambient=multiplier
0x10	1	red component 0-FF
0x11	1	green component 0-FF
0x12	1	blue component 0-FF
0x13	1	clouds 1-on/0-off
/*cloud-specific*/
0x14	2	default 5000; cloud image repeat value.  larger = more repetitions (pushed to DL)
0x16	1	default 00; offset from loaded sky image (8B6) to image entry used for sky.  
0x17	1	cloud red component 0-FF
0x18	1	cloud green component 0-FF
0x19	1	cloud blue component 0-FF
0x1A	1	unsigned byte	Nonzero='water'; also pulls the object ambient light value...
0x1B	1	RESERVED
/*water-specific*/
0x1C	2	default -1000; water image repeat value.  larger = more repetition (pushed to DL)
0x1E	1	default 01 or 02; offset to loaded water image entry.
0x1F	1	water highlight red component 0-FF
0x20	1	water highlight green component 0-FF
0x21	1	water highlight blue component 0-FF
0x22	1	world concavity distort!  positive makes world concave, negative world convex.  distorts perspective
0x23	1	RESERVED


currently active sky 8003E2B0, first sky at 8003E300
  format is the same as NTSC, so that means it will be really easy to port it!
8003E2B4	[float] near fog value
8003E2B8	[float] near fog * (intensity/far intensity)
8003E2BC	intensity
8003E2C0	far intensity
8003E2C4	fog colour
8003E2C8	[float] cloud repeat value
8003E2CC	offset to sky image
8003E2D0	[float] red component
8003E2D4	[float] green component
8003E2D8	[float] blue component
8003E2DC	water flag
8003E2E0	[float] water repeat value
8003E2E4	offset to water image
8003E2E8	[float] red component
8003E2EC	[float] green component
8003E2F0	[float] blue component
8003E2F4	[float] world distort
